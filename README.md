# LangChain Hands-On 

This repository contains practical examples, tutorials, and experiments with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), focusing on **building LLM-powered applications** using popular tools like **vector databases, retrievers, embeddings, and chains**.

The goal is to provide step-by-step, hands-on implementations of various LangChain concepts that you can easily run and extend.
